# Data-Visualization
Data Visualization exercises in R and Python. 


This is an exercise of making visualizations through R from data provided from various sources. The goal is to rundown through my notes in order to understand concepts learned from Epidemiology and Biostatistics. 

The "Charts and Graphs" folder are selected visualizations made from the R code in the "EPBI431 SelfPracticeFromNotes.R" file.
